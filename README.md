Determining the Impact of Haptic Feedback on the Speed and Accuracy of Target Selection in Virtual Reality Environments
===================

Abstract: As virtual reality (VR) becomes a more mainstream platform, the feedback given to the user is almost exclusively visual and auditory. An experiment was conducted in order to incorporate the sensation of touch. The hypothesis was that with the addition of haptic feedback, target selection would become quicker and more accurate in a virtual environment. The experiment consisted of two tasks: one to measure speed and another to measure accuracy. Both were conducted with and without the use of haptic feedback. An analysis of variance was conducted to test the correlation between the presence of haptics and speed and accuracy of target selection in VR space.  A p-value of 0.0509 was found for accuracy, suggesting correlation. A p-value of 0.2539 was found for speed, suggesting no correlation. The study results showed that vibro haptic feedback, improved the accuracy in target selection, but the speed was not improved.
